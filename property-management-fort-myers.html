            <section class="content-section">
                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much does property management cost in Fort Myers?</h3>
                    <p>All County Medallion Property Management typically charges 8-10% of monthly collected rent for standard management services. For a property renting at $2,000/month, this equals $160-$200 monthly. Tenant placement fees (50-100% of one month's rent) apply when finding new tenants. These fees are competitive with Fort Myers market rates and often result in net savings through reduced vacancy, lower maintenance costs, and optimized rental rates.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What services are included in the management fee?</h3>
                    <p>The monthly management fee covers rent collection, tenant communication, maintenance coordination, financial reporting, lease enforcement, regular property inspections, and 24/7 emergency response coordination. It does not include tenant placement, maintenance costs, or eviction proceedings, which are billed separately.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does it take to find a qualified tenant?</h3>
                    <p>In the Fort Myers market, All County Medallion typically fills vacancies within 15-30 days, depending on the property, rental price, and time of year. Their comprehensive marketing approach and established tenant networks often result in faster placement than individual landlords achieve. The seasonal nature of Fort Myers means properties listed in fall/winter generally rent faster than summer listings.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is the tenant screening process?</h3>
                    <p>All County Medallion conducts comprehensive screening including credit checks, criminal background checks, employment verification, income documentation (typically requiring 3x monthly rent), previous landlord references, and eviction history searches. All screening complies with Fair Housing regulations. This thorough process reduces the risk of problem tenants and helps ensure consistent rent payments.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I still access my property after hiring a property manager?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, you retain full ownership rights and can access your property with appropriate advance notice to tenants (typically 24-48 hours as required by Florida law). However, All County Medallion handles all routine access for inspections, maintenance, and showings. Most owners find they no longer need regular property access once professional management is in place.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How are maintenance and repairs handled?</h3>
                    <p>All County Medallion coordinates all maintenance and repairs through their network of licensed, insured contractors. Emergency repairs (defined as issues affecting safety or habitability) are handled immediately. Non-emergency repairs typically require owner approval for expenses exceeding $500, though owners can set their own approval thresholds. All repairs are documented with photos and receipts.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>When do I receive rental income?</h3>
                    <p>All County Medallion processes owner payments monthly via direct deposit, typically within 5-7 business days after rent is collected. Payments include detailed statements showing all income received and expenses paid during the month. You maintain 24/7 access to financial reports through their online owner portal.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What happens if a tenant doesn't pay rent?</h3>
                    <p>All County Medallion has established procedures for handling delinquencies. Late fees are assessed per the lease agreement. If rent remains unpaid after the grace period, they issue required legal notices and initiate eviction proceedings if necessary. You are not charged management fees during eviction periods, and they work to minimize the financial impact through rapid processing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I end the management agreement if I'm not satisfied?</h3>
                    <p>Most management agreements include a 30-90 day termination notice requirement. All County Medallion typically offers a 30-day out clause, giving you flexibility if circumstances change or if you're not satisfied with their service. However, their high owner retention rate suggests most clients remain satisfied long-term.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do you manage vacation rentals differently than annual rentals?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, vacation rental management involves different services including guest screening, turnover cleaning between stays, coordinating check-in/check-out, managing seasonal pricing, and marketing on vacation rental platforms. Vacation rental management fees (typically 15-20%) reflect these additional services. All County Medallion can advise whether annual or vacation rental management makes more sense for your specific property.</p>
